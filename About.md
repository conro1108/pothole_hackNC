Hello, and welcome to our pothole reporting system!


We are an extremely awesome group of passionate UNC students who made this project
for HackNC. We decided that driving around campus and around Chapel Hill can 
be hazardous when so many potholes exist in the road. These potholes only 
exist to pop our tires and make our road to graduation a very bumpy road indeed. 
If only there was a way for people to report potholes and for that recorded
information to go straight to the government. That information can then be processed
and the potholes of Chapel Thrill can finally be put to rest. We decided to make
this our project so that the we can reduce incidents on the road and make Chapel Hill
a safer community.
